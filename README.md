[OpenFGA](https://github.com/openfga/openfga) is a high-performance and flexible authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired by [Google Zanzibar](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/).

It is designed to make it easy for developers to model their application permissions and add and integrate fine-grained authorization into their applications.
